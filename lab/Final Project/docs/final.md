Machine Guidance and Machine Control excavators offer various innovative technologies and advantages compared to traditional excavators. Here's an explanation of these differences and strengths:

1. **Automation and Precision:**
   - *Machine Guidance:* Utilizes GPS and sensor technologies to monitor terrain in real-time and provide accurate location information, allowing operators to perform precise tasks.
   - *Machine Control:* Automated systems control the excavator, minimizing operator intervention and ensuring consistent accuracy.
2. **Productivity Enhancement:**
   - *Machine Guidance:* Defines job boundaries and efficiently operates within specified areas, improving productivity and preventing unnecessary work.
   - *Machine Control:* Accurate depth and angle control yield consistent results, increasing productivity and minimizing rework.
3. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - *Machine Guidance:* Collects various data during operations and analyzes it to enhance job efficiency. Real-time monitoring of soil conditions and job performance is possible.
   - *Machine Control:* Utilizes collected data to optimize productivity and predict maintenance tasks, enhancing machine reliability.
4. **Safety Reinforcement:**
   - *Machine Guidance:* Provides accurate location information of the work area, preventing collisions and enhancing safety.
   - *Machine Control:* Precise depth and angle control improve safety, reducing the risk of accidents during operations.
5. **Efficient Resource Utilization:**
   - *Machine Guidance and Machine Control:* Precise operations promote efficient resource utilization, optimizing fuel consumption for environmentally friendly operation.

*You need explain the overview of the design problem with a diagram and brief abstract*

## II. Problem

### Problem Description

*Detail description of the problem goes here.*

Your problem must have at least 3 modes(states). Explain necessary states(modes) and description

Example diagram:

img

Description of system modes, how your MCU should function and more

*For example:*

**1.** **System Mode:**

| **MODE**                    | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normal Mode (NORM_MODE)     | Pressing MODE_button (B1 of MCU_1) toggles from NORM_mode ðŸ¡¨ðŸ¡ªSECUR _mode |
| Security Mode (SECUR_MODE): | Pressing STOP_button (B1 of MCU_2) resets from SIREN_mode to SECUR_mode. |

**2.** **Front Door:**

| **MODE**                    | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Normal Mode (NORM_MODE)     | When a person is detected within the given distance from the door(outside): Keep turning on the door light as long as the person is present. When a person is detected inside the house nearby the door: Turn on the door light for given period of time and does not generates the SIREN _TRG trigger. |
| Security Mode (SECUR_MODE): | When a person is detected within the given distance from the door(outside): Keep turning on the door light as long as the person is present and sends the VISITOR_LOG message to the server. When a person is detected inside the house nearby the door: Keep turning on the door light and generates the SIREN _TRG trigger. |
